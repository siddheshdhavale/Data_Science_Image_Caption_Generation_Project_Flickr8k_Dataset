# Data_Science_Image_Caption_Generation_Project_Flickr8k_Dataset
Applying two different approaches, CNN + LSTM and ResNet + GRU, to automatically generate captions for images. Using Flickr 8k Dataset and pre-trained CNN/ResNet models to demonstrate the approaches. Finally comparing the performances of the two approaches by computing their BLEU scores.
